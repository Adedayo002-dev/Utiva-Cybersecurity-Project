# Utiva Cybersecurity Project

## Overview
This project was developed as part of my hands-on cybersecurity training at **Utiva**. It showcases my ability to perform real-world security tasks ‚Äî from vulnerability scanning and phishing simulations to SIEM setup and mobile app testing. Each activity mirrors the practical responsibilities of a cybersecurity analyst or SOC professional.

## Objectives
The goal of this project is to demonstrate core technical and analytical cybersecurity skills, including:
- Identifying and exploiting web application vulnerabilities using **Burp Suite**
- Scanning and analyzing network devices for weaknesses using **Nmap/Zenmap**
- Designing and executing a **phishing simulation** using open-source tools
- Deploying a **SIEM solution** to monitor, detect, and report security incidents
- Testing a **Damn Vulnerable Mobile Application (DVMA)** for mobile threats

## Deliverables
- **Vulnerability Assessment Report** (PortSwigger Labs)
- **Phishing Simulation Results & Recommendations**
- **SIEM Incident Detection Summary**
- **Mobile App Vulnerability Findings**

## Tools & Technologies
- **Burp Suite** ‚Äì Web application testing  
- **Nmap / Zenmap** ‚Äì Network vulnerability scanning  
- **Wazuh SIEM** ‚Äì Security monitoring and alerting  
- **GoPhish** ‚Äì Phishing simulation  
- **DVMA** ‚Äì Mobile app penetration testing  

## Key Achievements
- Gained real-world experience in **vulnerability management** and **incident detection**  
- Configured a functional **SIEM dashboard** for monitoring system activity  
- Identified and documented multiple vulnerabilities in test environments  
- Developed detailed reports outlining **mitigation strategies** and **security best practices**  

## Next Steps
Building on this foundation, I am pursuing continuous improvement through practical labs, capture-the-flag challenges, and internship opportunities to apply these skills in live enterprise environments.
